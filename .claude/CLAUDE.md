# Project Rules & Workflow

1. Always try to get the next task to be make on GitHub issues. If there's no issue, ask me what needs to be done.
2. Always when you pick a task to do, create a new branch and a PR as soon as possible. **Implement the feature and ask me to review what is being implemented in the PR**.
3. You should always write tests to ensure that what you are implementing is working as expected. And that the previous behaviors are kept while you add the new feature.
4. Always write tests according to Better Specs methodology.
